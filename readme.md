# NodeServer Project

This repository contains a simple Node.js server built with [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/). The purpose of this project is to help me learn and experiment with the Fastify framework, as well as improve my knowledge of server-side JavaScript development.

## Features

- Built with Fastify for high performance and low overhead.
- REST API endpoints for testing various features.
- Simulates HTTP requests using the REST Client extension in Visual Studio Code.
- Includes a `routes.http` file for easy HTTP request testing and simulation.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14+ recommended)
- A text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for using the REST Client extension)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodeServer.git
   cd nodeServer
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Fastify server:
    ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Use the REST Client extension to test the API by sending requests from the routes.http file.
